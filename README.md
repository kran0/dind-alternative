# dind-alternative
Alternative DIND docker in docker distribution.

# Why do you need alternate dind?

RHEL/Centos docker daemon differs from the official one.
 You can compare `docker --help` with `docker-ce --help`.
 Main difference for me is `--add-registry` flag,
 which is not supported by CE and official dockerd daemons.

# How to use?

This image is based on the [official dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker)
 and it must be fully compatible with it.

Please watch [official dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) image.
 If you new to DIND, then please use [official dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) .

You need this alternative dind distribution only if you know what you doing!

# How to run?

```bash

$ docker run --privileged --name dind -d \
   -p -p 2375:2375 \
   -v dind-storage:/car/lib/docker \
   kran0/dind-centos:latest --add-registry registry.company.name:5000

```
